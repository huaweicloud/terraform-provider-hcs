# Huawei Cloud Stack Provider

The Huawei Cloud Stack provider is used to interact with the many resources supported by Huawei Cloud Stack. The provider needs to be
configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

Terraform 0.13 and later:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    hcs = {
      source  = "huaweicloud/hcs"
      version = "~> 2.3.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the Huawei Cloud Stack Provider
provider "hcs" {
  region       = "cn-north-4"
  project_name = "my-project-name"
  cloud        = "mycloud.com"
  access_key   = "my-access-key"
  secret_key   = "my-secret-key"
}

# Create a VPC
resource "hcs_vpc" "example" {
  name = "my_vpc"
  cidr = "192.168.0.0/16"
}
```

## Authentication

The Huawei Cloud Stack provider offers a flexible means of providing credentials for authentication. The following methods are
supported, in this order, and explained below:

* Static credentials
* Environment variables

### Static credentials

!> **WARNING:** Hard-coding credentials into any Terraform configuration is not recommended, and risks secret leakage
should this file ever be committed to a public version control system.

Static credentials can be provided by adding an `access_key` and `secret_key`
in-line in the provider block:

Usage:

```hcl
provider "hcs" {
  region       = "cn-north-4"
  project_name = "my-project-name"
  cloud        = "mycloud.com"
  access_key   = "my-access-key"
  secret_key   = "my-secret-key"
}
```

### Environment variables

You can provide your credentials via the `HCS_ACCESS_KEY` and
`HCS_SECRET_KEY` environment variables, representing your Huawei Cloud Stack Access Key and Secret Key, respectively.

```hcl
provider "hcs" {}
```

Usage:

```sh
$ export HCS_ACCESS_KEY="anaccesskey"
$ export HCS_SECRET_KEY="asecretkey"
$ export HCS_REGION_NAME="cn-north-4"
$ export HCS_PROJECT_NAME="my-project-name"
$ export HCS_CLOUD="mycloud.com"
$ terraform plan
```

## Configuration Reference

The following arguments are supported:

## Testing and Development

In order to run the Acceptance Tests for development, the following environment variables must also be set:

* `HCS_CLOUD` - The endpoint of the Huawei Cloud Stack to use.

* `HCS_PROJECT_NAME` - The project name of the Huawei Cloud Stack to use.

* `HCS_REGION_NAME` - The region in which to create the resources.

You should be able to use any Huawei Cloud Stack environment to develop on as long as the above environment variables are set.
