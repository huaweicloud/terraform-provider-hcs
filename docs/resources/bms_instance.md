  and text files can be injected. `user_data` can come from a variety of sources: inline, read in from the
  *file* function. Changing this creates a new instance.

-> **NOTE:** If the `user_data` field is specified for a Linux BMS that is created using an image with Cloud-Init
installed, the `admin_pass` field becomes invalid.

  the instance. Changing this creates a new instance.

* `eip_id` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) The ID of the EIP. Changing this creates a new instance.

-> **NOTE:** If the eip_id parameter is configured, you do not need to configure the bandwidth parameters:
`iptype`, `eip_charge_mode`, `bandwidth_size`, `share_type` and `bandwidth_charge_mode`.

* `iptype` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Elastic IP type. Changing this creates a new instance.
  Available options are:
    + `5_bgp`: dynamic BGP.
    + `5_sbgp`: static BGP.

* `eip_charge_mode` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Elastic IP billing type. If the bandwidth billing mode is bandwidth,
  both prePaid and postPaid are supported. If the bandwidth billing mode is traffic, only postPaid is supported.

  month* and *year*. This parameter is mandatory if `charging_mode` is set to *prePaid*. Changing this creates a new
  instance.

* `period` - (Optional, Int, ForceNew) Specifies the charging period of the instance. If `period_unit` is set to *month*
  , the value ranges from 1 to 9. If `period_unit` is set to *year*, the value is 1. This parameter is mandatory
  if `charging_mode` is set to *prePaid*. Changing this creates a new instance.

  temporary credentials for BMS to access cloud services. Changing this creates a new instance.

The `nics` block supports:

* `subnet_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the ID of subnet to attach to the instance. Changing this creates
  a new instance.

* `ip_address` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies a fixed IPv4 address to be used on this network. Changing this
  creates a new instance.

The `data_disks` block supports:

* `type` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the BMS data disk type, which must be one of available disk types,
  contains of *SSD*, *GPSSD* and *SAS*. Changing this creates a new instance.

* `size` - (Required, Int, ForceNew) Specifies the data disk size, in GB. The value ranges form 10 to 32768. Changing
  this creates a new instance.
