GaussDB OpenGauss instance management within HuaweiCouldStack.

-> **NOTE:** If the endpoint is manually configured, both **opengauss** and **opengaussv31** should be configured.

## Example Usage

### Create an instance for distributed HA mode

```hcl
variable "vpc_id" {}
variable "subnet_network_id" {}
variable "security_group_id" {}
variable "instance_name" {}
variable "instance_password" {}

data "hcs_availability_zones" "test" {}

resource "hcs_gaussdb_opengauss_instance" "test" {
  vpc_id            = var.vpc_id
  subnet_id         = var.subnet_network_id
  security_group_id = var.security_group_id

  flavor            = "gaussdb.opengauss.ee.dn.m6.2xlarge.8.in"

  sharding_num      = 1
  coordinator_num   = 2
  availability_zone = join(",", slice(data.hcs_availability_zones.test.names, 0, 3))

  ha {
    mode             = "centralization_standard"

  backup time window. It must be a valid value in the **hh:mm-HH:MM** format. The current time is in the UTC format. The
  **HH** value must be `1` greater than the **hh** value. The values of mm and MM must be the same and must be set to
  **00**. Example value: **08:00-09:00**, **23:00-00:00**.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following timeouts configuration options:

* `create` - Default is 120 minutes.
* `update` - Default is 90 minutes.

## Import

OpenGaussDB instance can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import hcs_gaussdb_opengauss_instance.test 1f2c4f48adea4ae684c8edd8818fa349in14
```


Note that the imported state may not be identical to your resource definition, due to some attributes missing from the
API response, security or some other reason. The missing attributes include:
`password`, `availability_zone` and `ha.mode`.
It is generally recommended running `terraform plan` after importing a opengauss instance.
You can then decide if changes should be applied to the instance, or the resource
definition should be updated to align with the instance. Also, you can ignore changes as below.

```hcl
resource "hcs_gaussdb_opengauss_instance" "instance" {
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      password, availability_zone,
    ]
  }
}
```
