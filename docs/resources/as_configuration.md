# hcs_as_configuration

Manages an AS configuration resource within HuaweiCloudStack.

## Example Usage

### Basic AS Configuration

```hcl
variable "flavor_id" {}
variable "image_id" {}
variable "ssh_key" {}
variable "security_group_id" {}

resource "hcs_as_configuration" "my_as_config" {
  scaling_configuration_name = "my_as_config"

  instance_config {
    flavor             = var.flavor_id
    image              = var.image_id
    key_name           = var.ssh_key

    disk {
      size        = 40
      volume_type = "SSD"
      disk_type   = "SYS"
    }
  }
}
```

### AS Configuration With Encrypted Data Disk

```hcl
variable "flavor_id" {}
variable "image_id" {}
variable "ssh_key" {}
variable "kms_id" {}
variable "security_group_id" {}

resource "hcs_as_configuration" "my_as_config" {
  scaling_configuration_name = "my_as_config"

  instance_config {
    flavor             = var.flavor_id
    image              = var.image_id
    key_name           = var.ssh_key

    disk {
      size        = 40
      volume_type = "SSD"
      disk_type   = "SYS"
    }

    disk {
      size        = 100
      volume_type = "SSD"
      disk_type   = "DATA"
      kms_id      = var.kms_id
    }
  }
}
```

### AS Configuration With User Data and Metadata

```hcl
variable "flavor_id" {}
variable "image_id" {}
variable "ssh_key" {}
variable "security_group_id" {}

resource "hcs_as_configuration" "my_as_config" {
  scaling_configuration_name = "my_as_config"

  instance_config {
    flavor             = var.flavor_id
    image              = var.image_id
    key_name           = var.ssh_key
    user_data          = file("userdata.txt")

    disk {
      size        = 40
      volume_type = "SSD"
      disk_type   = "SYS"
    }

    metadata  = {
      some_key = "some_value"
    }
  }
}
```

### AS Configuration uses the existing instance specifications as the template

```hcl
variable "instance_id" {}
variable "ssh_key" {}
variable "security_group_id" {}

resource "hcs_as_configuration" "my_as_config" {
  scaling_configuration_name = "my_as_config"

  instance_config {
    instance_id        = var.instance_id
    key_name           = var.ssh_key
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the region in which to create the AS configuration.
  If omitted, the provider-level region will be used. Changing this will create a new resource.

* `scaling_configuration_name` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the AS configuration name.
  The name contains only letters, digits, underscores (_), and hyphens (-), and cannot exceed 64 characters.
  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `instance_config` - (Required, List, ForceNew) Specifies the information about instance configuration.
  The object structure is documented below. Changing this will create a new resource.

The `instance_config` block supports:

* `instance_id` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the ECS instance ID when using its specification
  as the template to create AS configurations. In this case, `flavor`, `image`, and `disk` arguments do not take effect.
  If this argument is not specified, `flavor`, `image`, and `disk` arguments are mandatory.
  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `flavor` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the ECS flavor name. A maximum of 10 flavors can be selected.
  Use a comma (,) to separate multiple flavor names. Changing this will create a new resource.

* `image` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the ECS image ID. Changing this will create a new resource.

* `disk` - (Optional, List, ForceNew) Specifies the disk group information. System disks are mandatory and
  data disks are optional. The [object](#instance_config_disk_object) structure is documented below.
  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `key_name` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the name of the SSH key pair used to log in to the instance.
  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `charging_mode` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies a billing mode for an ECS.
  The value can be `postPaid` and `spot`. The default value is `postPaid`.
  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `flavor_priority_policy` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the priority policy used when there are multiple flavors
  and instances to be created using an AS configuration. The value can be `PICK_FIRST` and `COST_FIRST`.

  + **PICK_FIRST** (default): When an ECS is added for capacity expansion, the target flavor is determined in the order
    in the flavor list.
  + **COST_FIRST**: When an ECS is added for capacity expansion, the target flavor is determined for minimal expenses.

  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `ecs_group_id` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the ECS group ID. Changing this will create a new resource.

* `user_data` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the user data to provide when launching the instance.
  The file content must be encoded with Base64. Changing this will create a new resource.

* `public_ip` - (Optional, List, ForceNew) Specifies the EIP of the ECS instance.
  The [object](#instance_config_public_ip_object) structure is documented below.
  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `metadata` - (Optional, Map, ForceNew) Specifies the key/value pairs to make available from within the instance.
  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `personality` - (Optional, List, ForceNew) Specifies the customize personality of an instance by defining one or
  more files and their contents. The [object](#instance_config_personality_object) structure is documented below.
  Changing this will create a new resource.

<a name="instance_config_disk_object"></a>
The `disk` block supports:

  + `SSD`: ultra-high I/O disk type.
  + `GPSSD`: general purpose SSD disk type.

* `disk_type` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies whether the disk is a system disk or a data disk.
  Option **DATA** indicates a data disk, option **SYS** indicates a system disk.
  Changing this will create a new resource.

* `kms_id` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the encryption KMS ID of the **DATA** disk.
  Changing this will create a new resource.

<a name="instance_config_public_ip_object"></a>
The `public_ip` block supports:

  size. The value can be **traffic** or **bandwidth**. Changing this creates a new resource.

* `size` - (Required, Int, ForceNew) Specifies the bandwidth (Mbit/s). The value range for bandwidth billed by bandwidth
  is 1 to 2000 and that for bandwidth billed by traffic is 1 to 300.
  Changing this creates a new resource.

<a name="instance_config_personality_object"></a>
The `personality` block supports:

* `path` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the path of the injected file. Changing this creates a new resource.

* `content` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the content of the injected file, which must be encoded with base64.
  Changing this creates a new resource.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The resource ID in UUID format.
* `status` - The AS configuration status, the value can be **Bound** or **Unbound**.

## Import

AS configurations can be imported by their `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import hcs_as_configuration.test 18518c8a-9d15-416b-8add-2ee874751d18
```

Note that the imported state may not be identical to your resource definition, due to `instance_config.0.instance_id`
is missing from the API response. You can ignore changes after importing an AS configuration as below.

```
resource "hcs_as_configuration" "test" {
  ...

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [ instance_config.0.instance_id ]
  }
}
```
